# mod_the_cube-unity
A challange as part of Unity's Create with Code course.
<p>Project hosted here: https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-167856</p>
<p>
  The challenge is to "mod the cube" - giving it a rotation, a color, etc. I had a good time taking it quite a bit further.<br>The cube's rotation is selected randomly when the project loads, and this routine was implemented in a method and called again every six seconds, resulting in a randomized rotation set again every six seconds.

<p>
   Additionally, I wasn't content to simply pick a color. I wrote in some virtual RGB color sliders and tied them to a timer where during each second of the timer one of the RGB sliders is moving up or down to/from its max/min value. The sliders follow a loop giving an RGB color-shifting effect.
